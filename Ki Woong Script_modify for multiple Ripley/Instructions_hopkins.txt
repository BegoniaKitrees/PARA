Instructions on Hopkin's analysis. 

Matlab code path: C:\Users\LIULAB\Desktop\PARA\Ki Woong Script_modify for multiple Ripley; (The code also run Ripley's analysis. You may skip it. We can get the Ripley's in clusdoc)
Run Rip_Hop_multiple_ROI_jx.m: 
1) Hit the green arrow; 
2) select the 3dlp file for Hopkin's analysis.
3) The code asks the total number of ROIs you will analyze. Put any number. We do 10 ROIs per cell in general. 
4) Select your ROIs. You will notice a new ROI number will be refreshed under the command window. 
5) Once you selected the preset number of ROIs, the code will start Hopkins' analysis. you will see histograms showing up. and status is updated in the command window. 
6) Results are saved in a folder "result" in the same folder as the input 3dlp file. The results of each region contain a histogram plot (.fig; .jpg) and a csv file. The csv file contains 4 numbers, they are 25%, 50% (median) and 75% percentile, mean. Transfer median and mean to prism and plot them.
